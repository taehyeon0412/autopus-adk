# Agent Teams Skill

## Overview

Agent Teams mode (`--team`) enables role-based team collaboration via Claude Code Agent Teams. Instead of spawning ephemeral subagents per task, this mode creates persistent teammates that communicate directly, share a task list, and self-coordinate through the pipeline.

**Activation flag**: `/auto go SPEC-ID --team`

## Activation

Requires the experimental environment variable:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
```

If this variable is not set, the pipeline MUST error with:

```
Error: Agent Teams mode requires CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1
Fallback: Run without --team to use the subagent pipeline mode.
```

## Team Roles

### Lead (1 agent)

**Responsibilities**: planner + reviewer

- Creates the team and assigns tasks via `SendMessage`
- Runs Phase 1 (Planning) to produce the execution plan
- Assigns tasks to Builder(s) and Guardian
- Monitors task list and consolidates results
- Runs Phase 4 (Review) and finalizes output
- Re-assigns or falls back to subagent if a teammate fails

### Builder (1–2 agents)

**Responsibilities**: executor + tester + annotator + frontend-specialist

- Implements code following TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- Writes tests in Phase 1.5 (Test Scaffold) before implementation
- Executes Phase 2 (Implementation) in an isolated worktree
- Applies `@AX` annotation tags in Phase 2.5 (Annotation)
- Communicates validation requests to Guardian via `SendMessage`
- Reports completion to Lead via `SendMessage`

### Guardian (1 agent)

**Responsibilities**: validator + security-auditor + perf-engineer

- Executes Gate 2 (Validation): coverage, lint, race conditions
- Performs security audit on modified files
- Monitors performance regressions
- Responds to partial validation requests from Builder
- Reports validation results to Lead via `SendMessage`

## Team Creation Pattern

```python
# Lead creates the team at pipeline start
team = TeamCreate(team_name=f"team-{spec_id}")

# Spawn teammates
lead    = Teammate(role="lead",     model="opus")
builder = Teammate(role="builder",  model="sonnet")  # or haiku for LOW complexity
guardian = Teammate(role="guardian", model="sonnet")
```

Task assignment via `SendMessage`:

```python
# Lead → Builder
SendMessage(to="builder", message={
    "phase": "Phase 2",
    "tasks": [...],
    "worktree": "<path>"
})

# Lead → Guardian
SendMessage(to="guardian", message={
    "phase": "Gate 2",
    "target_branch": "<branch>",
    "coverage_threshold": 85
})
```

## Execution Flow

```
Lead: Phase 1 (Planning)
  → Assigns tasks to Builder(s) and Guardian

Builder: Phase 1.5 (Test Scaffold)
  → Writes failing tests first (RED)

Builder: Phase 2 (Implementation)
  → GREEN phase in isolated worktree
  → Merge back after completion

Builder: Phase 2.5 (Annotation)
  → Applies @AX tags to modified files

Guardian: Gate 2 (Validation)
  → go test -race ./...
  → Coverage check (85%+)
  → golangci-lint run
  → Security audit

Lead: Phase 4 (Review)
  → Consolidates all results
  → Final quality check
  → Produces review report
```

## Builder-Guardian Direct Communication (P1-R3)

Builder can request partial validation from Guardian without waiting for Lead coordination:

```python
# Builder → Guardian (partial validation request)
SendMessage(to="guardian", message={
    "type": "partial_validation",
    "files": ["pkg/foo/bar.go"],
    "reason": "security-sensitive change"
})

# Guardian → Builder (validation result)
SendMessage(to="builder", message={
    "type": "validation_result",
    "status": "PASS",  # or FAIL
    "issues": []
})
```

All direct interactions are logged in the pipeline log:

```
[P1-R3] builder → guardian: partial_validation request (pkg/foo/bar.go)
[P1-R3] guardian → builder: PASS
```

## Subagent Fallback Strategy

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` not set | Error + fallback guidance to use subagent pipeline |
| Builder teammate fails mid-task | Lead re-assigns task to another Builder or spawns a subagent |
| Guardian teammate fails | Lead falls back to subagent validator with `Agent(subagent_type="validator")` |
| Team creation fails | Abort and fall back to default subagent pipeline |

## Worktree Isolation

The same worktree isolation rules (R1–R5 from `worktree-isolation.md`) apply in Agent Teams mode:

- Each Builder teammate works in an independent git worktree
- Maximum 5 simultaneous worktrees
- GC suppression: `git -c gc.auto=0 <command>` required during parallel execution
- Exponential backoff on shared resource lock contention (3s → 6s → 12s)
- Failed worktrees cleaned up with `git worktree remove --force <path>`
