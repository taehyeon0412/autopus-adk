## Overview

This document is a reserved placeholder for a future native Codex multi-agent / teams surface.

**Activation flag**: ` + "`@auto go SPEC-ID --team`" + `

Today, Codex should continue to use the default ` + "`spawn_agent(...)`" + ` subagent pipeline. Do not reinterpret ` + "`--team`" + ` as extra parallel orchestration in the harness.

## Current Behavior

- ` + "`@auto go`" + ` without flags: use the default subagent pipeline
- ` + "`@auto go --solo`" + `: disable subagents and stay in the main session
- ` + "`@auto go --team`" + `: keep compatibility with future native multi-agent naming, but continue with the default subagent pipeline for now

## Why This Is Reserved

- Codex already supports subagents natively via ` + "`spawn_agent(...)`" + `
- Public Codex docs do not define a separate local CLI Team API equivalent to Claude Code Agent Teams
- Overloading ` + "`--team`" + ` to mean "extra ` + "`spawn_agent(...)`" + ` fan-out" would conflict with the likely future meaning of native multi-agent support

## What To Use Instead

- Use ` + "`.codex/skills/agent-pipeline.md`" + ` for the default execution model
- Use ` + "`.codex/agents/*.toml`" + ` as the role source of truth for spawned workers
- Use ` + "`.codex/skills/worktree-isolation.md`" + ` when parallel ownership boundaries are explicit

## Revisit Condition

Enable a real ` + "`--team`" + ` route only when Codex exposes a documented native multi-agent surface that is distinct from ordinary subagent spawning.

# Agent Pipeline Skill

Default multi-agent execution model for ` + "`@auto go`" + ` in Codex.

## Activation

This skill is the default for ` + "`@auto go SPEC-ID`" + `.

| Flag | Mode | Codex meaning |
|------|------|---------------|
| none | Subagent pipeline | Main session orchestrates specialists phase-by-phase |
| ` + "`--team`" + ` | Reserved compatibility flag | Keep the default subagent pipeline until Codex ships a documented native multi-agent surface |
| ` + "`--solo`" + ` | Single session | No worker spawning; implement directly in the main session |
| ` + "`--multi`" + ` | Multi-provider review | Run additional review/validation passes when configured, prefer orchestra-backed review when available |

See .codex/skills/agent-teams.md for the reserved ` + "`--team`" + ` policy and .codex/skills/worktree-isolation.md for parallel ownership rules.

## Phase 0.5: Autonomy Policy

Before spawning workers, decide whether the pipeline can proceed autonomously:

- If ` + "`--auto`" + ` is set, continue without confirmation.
- If user intent is ambiguous, ask one concise plain-text question in the main session.
- Do not rely on Claude-only permission or question APIs.

## Pipeline Overview

` + "```text" + `
Phase 1:   Planning        -> planner
Phase 1.5: Test Scaffold   -> tester        (optional)
Gate 1:    Approval        -> main session  (skip with --auto)
Phase 1.8: Doc Fetch       -> main session  (fetch current docs if needed)
Phase 2:   Implementation  -> executor x N  (parallel only with disjoint ownership)
Gate 2:    Validation      -> validator
Phase 2.5: Annotation      -> annotator
Phase 3:   Testing         -> tester
Phase 3.5: UX Verify       -> frontend-specialist (optional)
Phase 4:   Review          -> reviewer + security-auditor
` + "```" + `

## Quality Mode

Quality mode influences model choice, not platform semantics:

- Ultra: pass ` + "`model=\"opus\"`" + ` to spawned workers
- Balanced: use each role's default model
- Adaptive: choose stronger models only for high-complexity tasks

Reference: .codex/skills/adaptive-quality.md

## Phase Guidance

### Phase 1: Planning

Spawn a planner when the task has enough scope to justify decomposition.

` + "```python" + `
spawn_agent(
    agent_type="planner",
    fork_context=True,
    message="""
    Read SPEC-XXX.
    Produce an execution table with task id, owner role, mode, and file ownership.
    Mark only truly independent tasks as parallel.
    """,
)
` + "```" + `

### Phase 1.5: Test Scaffold

When enabled, spawn a tester to write failing tests before implementation. Generated scaffold tests are read-only for later executors unless the plan explicitly reassigns them.

### Phase 1.8: Doc Fetch

This phase stays in the main session. Use current documentation tools available in the session and inject only the relevant excerpts into later worker prompts.

### Phase 2: Implementation

Parallel implementation is valid only with disjoint ownership.

` + "```python" + `
spawn_agent(
    agent_type="executor",
    fork_context=True,
    message="""
    Own only: pkg/auth/*.
    Follow TDD for task T1.
    Return changed files, tests run, and unresolved issues.
    """,
)
` + "```" + `

When workers return, review and integrate their results in the main session. Do not assume Codex auto-merges worktree branches.

### Gate 2: Validation

Spawn a validator after implementation lands. If validation fails, respawn a focused fixer instead of rerunning the full pipeline blindly.

### Phase 2.5: Annotation

Run annotator after validation PASS. Harness-only markdown changes may skip this phase.

### Phase 3 / 3.5: Testing and UX Verification

- Tester raises coverage and adds edge-case tests
- Frontend-specialist runs only when changed files include frontend UI

### Phase 4: Review

Run reviewer and security-auditor in parallel when the change scope justifies both. When ` + "`--multi`" + ` is set, prefer an additional orchestra-backed review/decision pass after local validation if the CLI/config supports it. Consolidate findings in the main session.

## Parallelism Rules

| Condition | Execution |
|----------|-----------|
| Non-overlapping ownership | Parallel workers allowed |
| Shared file or shared migration | Sequential execution |
| Order dependency between tasks | Sequential execution |
| One worker blocked on another's output | Wait, integrate, then continue |

## Retry Policy

- Validation: up to 3 retries, or 5 with ` + "`--loop`" + `
- Review: up to 2 retries, or 3 with ` + "`--loop`" + `
- Repeated worker failure: shrink scope or fall back to the main session

## Result Integration

Each worker should return:

- changed files
- verification run
- blockers or assumptions

The main session owns final integration, status updates, and the decision to continue, retry, or stop.

func codexWorktreeIsolationSkillBody() string {
	return `
# Worktree Isolation Skill

Codex parallel work should be isolated by ownership first, and by workspace strategy second.

## Overview

The default isolation model in Codex is the worker's forked workspace created by ` + "`spawn_agent(...)`" + `. Do not assume an implicit worktree flag or automatic git worktree creation.

This skill defines when parallel work is safe and how the main session should integrate results.

## Default Isolation Model

- Each parallel worker gets a disjoint file ownership slice
- Each worker edits only its assigned slice in its own forked workspace
- The main session reviews and integrates returned changes

If ownership cannot be separated cleanly, do not parallelize.

## Activation Conditions

Use this guidance when:

- ` + "`@auto go`" + ` is running in default pipeline or Codex ` + "`--team`" + ` mode
- planner marks tasks as parallel
- ownership rules are explicit and non-overlapping

Do not use parallel isolation when:

- tasks touch the same file
- migrations or generated outputs must be serialized
- a task depends on a previous task's concrete output

## Ownership Validation

Before spawning parallel workers, compare ownership patterns:

1. Same literal file: conflict
2. Same directory with overlapping globs: conflict
3. Parent/child directory ownership: conflict
4. Different directories with no shared generated output: safe

On conflict, downgrade to sequential execution and log the reason.

## Parallel Worker Contract

Every parallel worker prompt should include:

- exact owned paths
- forbidden paths
- expected tests or checks
- required return format

Example:

` + "```python" + `
spawn_agent(
    agent_type="executor",
    fork_context=True,
    message="""
    Own only: pkg/auth/*, internal/auth/*
    Do not edit: pkg/api/*, migrations/*
    Return changed files and tests run.
    """,
)
` + "```" + `

## Integration Flow

After workers complete:

1. Review returned file lists and assumptions
2. Integrate changes in the main session
3. Run validation after integration, not before
4. If overlap or regressions appear, continue sequentially

## Optional Manual Git Worktree Path

For advanced multi-session workflows, the main session may still create explicit git worktrees with standard git commands. That is an operator choice, not an implicit Codex agent feature.

When using manual git worktrees:

- create them in the main session
- assign one worktree per ownership slice
- merge in a deterministic order
- remove worktrees after successful integration

## Safety Rules

- Prefer ownership separation over git complexity
- Keep validation workers read-only
- Stop parallel execution on merge conflicts or ownership ambiguity
- Never auto-resolve overlapping edits without review

## Multi-Session Guidance

When using multiple terminals or tmux panes:

- one session owns one concern slice
- keep branch names explicit
- merge in a known order after all sessions complete

If these constraints feel heavy for the task, use the default sequential pipeline instead.

# Subagent Development Skill

Guide for designing Codex worker roles and orchestrating them safely.

## Codex Primitives

Codex orchestration uses these primitives:

- ` + "`spawn_agent(...)`" + ` for new workers
- ` + "`send_input(...)`" + ` for follow-up instructions
- ` + "`wait_agent(...)`" + ` for synchronization
- ` + "`close_agent(...)`" + ` when a worker is no longer needed

Do not design around Claude-only team primitives or assumptions about direct worker-to-worker messaging.

## Agent Definitions

Harness reference agent definitions live under .codex/agents/. They document role scope, review posture, and expected outputs for roles such as ` + "`planner`" + `, ` + "`executor`" + `, ` + "`tester`" + `, and ` + "`validator`" + `.

Use those definitions as role contracts. The main session is still responsible for choosing the correct ` + "`agent_type`" + ` and passing explicit ownership.

## Design Principles

### Single Responsibility

Each worker should own one clear concern:

- implementation
- testing
- validation
- review

Avoid prompts that ask one worker to plan, implement, review, and secure the same slice.

### Ownership First

Every coding worker prompt should state:

- files or modules it owns
- files it must not edit
- completion criteria
- expected return format

### Context Completeness

Workers do not share mutable session state automatically. Include the SPEC id, acceptance criteria, and any relevant constraints in the prompt or via ` + "`fork_context`" + `.

## Orchestration Patterns

### Fan-Out / Fan-In

Use for independent slices:

` + "```text" + `
main session -> worker A
             -> worker B
             -> worker C
             -> integrate results
` + "```" + `

### Pipeline

Use when each step depends on the previous result:

` + "```text" + `
planner -> executor -> validator -> reviewer
` + "```" + `

### Supervisor

Use the main session as supervisor:

- detect blockers
- respawn narrower workers
- decide when to fall back to sequential execution

## Practical Prompt Pattern

` + "```python" + `
spawn_agent(
    agent_type="executor",
    fork_context=True,
    message="""
    Own only: pkg/auth/*
    Goal: implement token refresh flow
    Tests: update auth service tests only
    Return: changed files, tests run, unresolved blockers
    """,
)
` + "```" + `

## Completion Checklist

- Role is narrow and concrete
- Ownership is explicit
- Validation path is assigned
- Retry/fallback behavior is defined
- Parallel workers have disjoint write scopes
